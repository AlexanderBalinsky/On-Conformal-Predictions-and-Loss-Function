This is my summer internship project in the Computer Science Department at The University of London in Royal Holloway (August - September, 2023). We aim to demonstrate that conformal predictions can be interpreted as a hypothesis test with a p-value. In this test, the ‘statistic’ is defined by machine learning algorithms, and the probability with respect to an unknown probability distribution is replaced by an empirical p-value.
